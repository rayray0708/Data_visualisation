##Description: In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. I'm tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study and producing a top-level summary of the study results.
